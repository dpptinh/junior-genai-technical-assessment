<details - open>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Optimizing LiteLLM for Production Environments</summary>

---



#### Configuration (`config.yaml`)
- **Using `config.yaml`:** Strongly recommended for production to centrally manage settings for the LiteLLM Proxy or SDK Router.
- **Key `config.yaml` sections:**
    - `model_list`: Define LLM models, API keys (can reference env vars), `api_base`, RPM/TPM limits.
    - `litellm_settings`: General settings like `master_key` (for Proxy), `alerting`, `set_verbose`.
    - `general_settings`: Caching, database logging.
    - `router_settings`: Specific settings for `litellm.Router` if used.
    - `proxy_server_settings`: For LiteLLM Proxy deployment.
- **Example `config.yaml` snippet:**
  ```yaml
  model_list:
    - model_name: gpt-4-proxy
      litellm_params:
        model: gpt-4-turbo
        api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY
    - model_name: claude-3-sonnet-proxy
      litellm_params:
        model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229
        api_key: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

  litellm_settings:
    fallbacks: [{"gpt-4-proxy": ["claude-3-sonnet-proxy"]}]
    set_verbose: False
  ```
- **Using `config.yaml` with LiteLLM Proxy:**
  ```bash
  litellm --config /path/to/your/config.yaml
  ```

---

#### LiteLLM Proxy Server Features
- **Deployment:** Docker is common.
- **API Key Management & User-Specific Keys:** Create virtual keys for users/teams.
- **Routing Strategies:** Simple, Weighted, Least-Busy.
- **Budget Management & Cost Control üí∞:** Track costs by user/key/model, set budgets.

---

#### Logging & Observability üìä
- **JSON Logs:** For easy integration with log management systems.
- **Callbacks for Observability Tools:** LiteLLM supports direct logging to various platforms.
```python
  from litellm import completion, success_callback
  import os

  # Set environment variables for logging tools
  os.environ["LUNARY_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "your-lunary-public-key"
  os.environ["HELICONE_API_KEY"] = "your-helicone-key"
  os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "your-langfuse-public-key"
  os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "your-langfuse-secret-key"
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-key" # Still needed for the actual call

  # Set callbacks (example, choose what you use)
  success_callback = ["lunary", "helicone", "langfuse"] # Add "mlflow" if using it
  litellm.success_callback = success_callback


  # Example call that would be logged if callbacks are set
  try:
      response = completion(
          model="gpt-4o-mini", 
          messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Log this call to my observability tools!"}]
      )
      print(response.choices.message.content)
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error: {e}")
  ```
- **Integration with Standard Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, LangWatch (via OpenTelemetry).

---

#### Load Balancing & Routing (SDK's `Router`)
- The `litellm.Router` allows you to load balance between multiple deployments of the same model or different models.
```python
  from litellm import Router
  import os
  import asyncio # For acompletion

  # Ensure API keys are set as environment variables
  os.environ["AZURE_API_KEY"] = "your_azure_key"
  os.environ["AZURE_API_BASE"] = "your_azure_api_base"
  os.environ["AZURE_API_VERSION"] = "your_azure_api_version"
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_openai_key"

  model_list = [
      {
          "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", # Alias for load balancing
          "litellm_params": {
              "model": "azure/your-azure-chatgpt-deployment", # Actual Azure deployment name
              "api_key": os.getenv("AZURE_API_KEY"),
              "api_version": os.getenv("AZURE_API_VERSION"),
              "api_base": os.getenv("AZURE_API_BASE")
          },
          "tpm": 240000, "rpm": 1800 # Optional: capacity limits
      },
      {
          "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini",
          "litellm_params": {
              "model": "gpt-4o-mini", # OpenAI's model
              "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
          },
          "tpm": 1000000, "rpm": 9000
      }
  ]

  router = Router(model_list=model_list)

  async def main():
      try:
          # Requests with model="gpt-4o-mini" will be load-balanced
          response = await router.acompletion(
              model="gpt-4o-mini", 
              messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke."}]
          )
          print(response.choices.message.content)
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Router Error: {e}")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      # asyncio.run(main()) # Uncomment to run
      pass # Placeholder if keys are not set
  ```

<summary>Basic LangGraph Tutorial</summary>

---

### What is LangGraph?
<details - open>
<summary>üìú Introduction, Core Concepts, and Key Differentiators of LangGraph</summary>

---

- **Introduction & Overview:**
    - LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor AI applications, particularly **graph-based agents**. It extends LangChain.
    - It allows you to define agentic RAG, chatbots, and other applications as graphs where nodes represent computation (LLMs, tools, Python functions) and edges define the flow.
    - **Key characteristics:**
        - **Explicit State Management:** Clearly defined state passed between nodes.
        - **Controllable Agent Flow:** Easy to manage how the agent progresses.
        - **Support for Cycles/Loops üîÑ:** Enables iterative processes, self-correction.
        - **Conditional Branching üå≥:** Allows for decision-making within the agent's flow.
        - **Persistence üíæ:** Can save and resume agent state.
    - Integrates well with LangChain's ecosystem (prompts, tools, retrievers).
- **Difference from sequential LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):**
    - LCEL is for DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) ‚Äì linear or simple branching.
    - LangGraph allows cycles, crucial for more complex agent behaviors like self-correction or iterative refinement.

---

#### LangGraph Core Concepts
- **State:** An object (TypedDict, Pydantic model) holding data passed and updated between nodes.
- **Nodes:** Python functions or LCEL Runnables performing work. They receive the current state and return updates.
- **Edges:** Connect nodes, directing flow.
    - **Conditional Edges:** Branch flow based on state evaluation.
    - **`START` and `END`:** Define graph entry and termination points.
- **Graph (`StateGraph`):** The collection of nodes and edges.
- **CompiledGraph:** The executable object created after defining the graph.

---
</details>

### Workflow Capabilities & Agent Patterns
<details - open>
<summary>üß© Applying LangGraph in Building Agents and Workflows</summary>

---

- **Building self-correcting agents:** Agents can evaluate results and loop back to retry or refine.
- **Implementing complex agent patterns:**
    - **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting):** Iterative cycle of thought -> action (tool use) -> observation.
        - **Mermaid Diagram: ReAct Loop**
          ```mermaid
          graph TD
            U[üßë‚Äçüíª User Query] --> A[üí° Thought: What to do next?];
            A --> B{üõ†Ô∏è Action: Use Tool or Respond}
            B -- Tool Selected --> C[üîß Execute Tool];
            C --> D[üëÄ Observation: Get Tool Result];
            D --> A;
            B -- Respond --> E[‚úÖ Final Answer];

          ```
    - **Plan-and-Execute:** Agent first plans steps, then executes them.
- **Building multi-agent systems:** Multiple agents (sub-graphs) collaborating.
- **Human-in-the-loop üßë‚Äçüíª:** Integrate human review/approval points.
- **Advanced chatbots and interactive AI:** Complex, context-aware conversational flows.

### LangGraph Installation and Basic Usage (Python Examples)
<details - open>
<summary>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps and Illustrative Code for LangGraph</summary>

---

- **Installation:**
```python
  pip install langgraph langchain_openai # Or other LLM/Langchain packages
```

- **Basic Chatbot Node Example:**
```python
  from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
  from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages # Helper for managing message lists in state
  from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
  from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage

  # Define the state for our graph
  class ChatState(TypedDict):
      # `add_messages` is a utility to append messages to this list
      messages: Annotated[list[BaseMessage], add_messages]

  # Define a node that simulates a chatbot response
  def chatbot_node(state: ChatState):
      # For this basic example, we're just adding a fixed response.
      # In a real app, this node would likely call an LLM.
      print("üí¨ Chatbot Node Executing")
      # `add_messages` expects the new message and the existing state (or just new message)
      # Here, we are creating a new list of messages to be added.
      # If state['messages'] already existed, add_messages would append to it.
      return {"messages": [("ai", "Hello! How can I help you today?")]}


    #Initialize the graph
    graph = StateGraph(ChatState)

    #Add the node
    graph.add_node("ask_user_initial_greeting", chatbot_node)

    #Set the entry point for the graph
    graph.set_entry_point("ask_user_initial_greeting")

    # Set the finish point (in this simple case, it's the same node)
    graph.add_edge("ask_user_initial_greeting", END) # Or graph.set_finish_point("ask_user_initial_greeting")

    # Compile the graph into a runnable app
    app = graph.compile()

    Invoke the app with an initial empty list of messages
    try:
        initial_state = {"messages": []}
        result = app.invoke(initial_state)
        print("\nFinal State:")
        for msg_source, msg_content in result.get("messages", []):
            print(f"{msg_source.upper()}: {msg_content}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error invoking graph: {e}")
```
*(Note: The more complex example with conditional edges from the previous version is also very illustrative and can be kept or referred to for advanced patterns).*

### When to Use Which Tool? (Decision Framework) ü§î
<details - open>
<summary>üí° A Framework for Choosing Between LiteLLM and LangGraph</summary>

---

- **Use LiteLLM if:**
    - You need to switch between multiple LLM providers or models easily.
    - You want to reduce costs through intelligent routing, fallbacks, and caching.
    - You need better management of LLM requests (timeouts, logging, permissions, rate limits).
    - You need rapid integration with various LLM backends via a unified API (SDK or Proxy).
    - Cost tracking and budget control for LLM usage are paramount.
- **Use LangGraph if:**
    - You are building agents with multi-step logic that require maintaining state.
    - You need clear control over the agent's flow, including conditional branching and loops.
    - You want to easily expand agent capabilities and debug/test complex interactions.
    - You are implementing patterns like ReAct, self-correction, or multi-agent systems.
- **Use Both (LiteLLM + LangGraph) if:**
    - You need the sophisticated agent logic and workflow control of LangGraph, AND
    - You want the flexibility, cost control, and reliability of LiteLLM for the actual LLM calls made by the agent's nodes. (This is often the most powerful approach for production GenAI).

### Why Integrate?
<details - open>
<summary>üåü Benefits of Combining LiteLLM and LangGraph</summary>

---

- **LangGraph nodes need to call LLMs:** For reasoning, generation, tool use decisions.
- **LiteLLM provides a robust LLM access layer:**
    - **Model Flexibility:** Change LLMs in LiteLLM config without altering LangGraph node code.
    - **Fallback & Reliability:** LiteLLM handles LLM provider errors.
    - **Cost Control:** Centralized cost tracking for LLM calls within the agent.
    - **Simplified Node Code:** Consistent `litellm.completion()` calls.
- **Enhances "Production-Readiness" for LangGraph Agents:** Decouples agent logic from LLM infrastructure management.

### Common Integration Patterns & Examples
<details - open>
<summary>üîó Practical Ways and Code to Combine LiteLLM and LangGraph</summary>

---

- **Pattern: LangGraph Nodes use LiteLLM for LLM Calls**
    - This is the primary integration strategy.
    - Within a LangGraph node requiring an LLM, use `litellm.completion()` instead of a provider-specific SDK.
    - LiteLLM (via its config or environment variables) manages model selection, API keys, fallbacks, etc.
