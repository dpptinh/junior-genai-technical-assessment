# üìä LiteLLM & LangGraph: Comprehensive Analysis and Implementation Guide

---
## Executive Summary & Key Concepts
---

### High-Level Overview for Stakeholders
<details - open>
<summary>Understand LiteLLM and LangGraph in 60 Seconds</summary>

---

- **Core Purpose**: This document provides a technical deep-dive and strategic comparison of two essential GenAI tools, **LiteLLM** and **LangGraph**, to guide development teams in making informed architectural decisions.

- **What is LiteLLM?**
  - Think of LiteLLM as a **universal adapter for Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
  - It provides a single, consistent way for an application to communicate with over 100 different LLM providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and local models via Ollama).
  - Its primary role is to manage and standardize the *communication layer* with LLMs.

- **What is LangGraph?**
  - Think of LangGraph as an **intelligent workflow orchestrator or a flowchart for AI agents**.
  - It is used to build complex, multi-step applications where the AI needs to "think," use tools, correct itself, or follow a logical path with loops and branches.
  - Its primary role is to manage the *logic and state* of an AI agent.

- **The Synergy**:
  - LangGraph defines the agent's "brain" (the workflow and logic).
  - LiteLLM provides the "nervous system" (the reliable communication channel to various LLMs).
  - Using them together allows for the creation of sophisticated, reliable, and cost-effective AI systems.

</details>

### Terminology
<details - open>
<summary>Glossary of Essential Terms</summary>

---

- **LiteLLM**: A Python library that provides a unified API interface to call over 100+ LLMs, simplifying model integration and management.
- **LangGraph**: An extension of the LangChain library used to build stateful, multi-actor AI applications (agents) as graphs, enabling complex workflows with cycles and conditional logic.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: An AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3).
- **Agent**: An AI system that can reason, make decisions, and use tools to accomplish a task. LangGraph is used to build these.
- **State**: A data object that stores and passes information between different steps (nodes) in a LangGraph workflow. It represents the agent's memory.
- **Node**: A function or computational step within a LangGraph graph. A node can call an LLM, execute a tool, or perform any Python logic.
- **Edge**: A connection between nodes in a LangGraph graph that defines the flow of control and data. Edges can be conditional, creating branches in the workflow.
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)**: A set of tools and libraries used to develop applications for a specific platform. The LiteLLM SDK is used directly in Python code.
- **Proxy Server**: A central server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. The LiteLLM Proxy is a gateway for all LLM traffic.

## LiteLLM Deep Dive
---

### What is LiteLLM?
<details - open>
<summary>üìú Core Concepts, Functionality, and Architecture</summary>

---

- **Definition**:
  - LiteLLM is a lightweight, open-source Python library that acts as a standardized abstraction layer for interacting with a vast ecosystem of over 100 LLMs.
  - It supports major providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (VertexAI), Azure OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, and local models via Ollama.

- **Primary Objective**:
  - To simplify the process of calling any LLM API by providing a consistent, OpenAI-like function call format (`litellm.completion()`).

#### Core Functionality

- **Unified API Interface**:
  - The cornerstone feature. Call any supported LLM using the same input structure and receive a standardized output object. This drastically reduces code changes when switching models.

- **Deployment Flexibility**:
  - **Python SDK**: For direct integration within an application's codebase. Ideal for simpler setups or when you want logic self-contained.
  - **Proxy Server (LLM Gateway)**: A standalone, centralized service that manages all LLM requests. This is the recommended approach for production systems with multiple services, as it centralizes control, logging, and security.

- **Production-Grade Features**:
  - **Cost Management**: Track spending per API key, model, or project in real-time and set budgets to prevent overruns.
  - **Robustness & Reliability**: Implement automatic retries on failures and define fallback models (e.g., if `gpt-4o` fails, automatically try `claude-3-sonnet`).
  - **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple deployments of the same model (e.g., between two Azure OpenAI instances or an Azure and standard OpenAI endpoint).
  - **Observability & Logging**: Native integration with tools like Langfuse, Helicone, Lunary, and OpenTelemetry for detailed tracing and monitoring.
  - **Caching**: Reduce latency and cost by caching identical requests, with support for Redis, Memcached, or local in-memory caching.
  - **Virtual API Keys**: Create user-specific keys that map to real provider keys, enabling granular access control and usage tracking.

</details>

### Use Cases & Deployment Choices
<details - open>
<summary>üõ†Ô∏è When to Use LiteLLM: Proxy Server vs. Python SDK</summary>

---

- **General Scenarios for LiteLLM**:
  - **Avoiding Vendor Lock-In**: Build applications that can seamlessly switch between LLM providers.
  - **Cost Optimization**: Use intelligent routing to select the most cost-effective model for a given task and leverage caching to reduce redundant calls.
  - **A/B Testing Models**: Easily test the performance of different models for the same task without rewriting application logic.
  - **Centralized Governance**: Manage all LLM API keys, access controls, and spending limits from a single control plane (via the Proxy).
  - **Resilience**: Ensure application uptime by automatically falling back to a different model or provider during an outage.
  - **Simplifying Development**: Provide a single, simple interface for developers to use any LLM, abstracting away the complexity of different provider SDKs.

- **Choosing Your Deployment Method**:
  | Scenario | Recommended Choice | Why? |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **Developing a single Python script or a small, self-contained application** | **Python SDK** | Simple, no external service to manage. `litellm.Router` can still provide fallbacks and load balancing within the app. |
  | **Building a microservices architecture or enterprise-level application** | **Proxy Server** | Centralizes all LLM traffic, providing a single point for security, logging, cost control, and key management across all services. |
  | **Needing to provide LLM access to non-Python applications** | **Proxy Server** | The Proxy exposes a standard REST API, making it accessible from any programming language. |
  | **Requiring granular user-level budget and access control** | **Proxy Server** | The Proxy's virtual key system is designed specifically for this purpose. |

### Installation and Basic Usage
<details - open>
<summary>‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Python Code Examples</summary>

---

- **Installation (SDK)**:
  ```bash
  pip install litellm
  ```

- **Basic Usage (SDK)**:
  - **CRITICAL**: Always set API keys as environment variables for security. LiteLLM automatically detects them.
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
    ```

  - **Calling different models with the same unified format**:
    ```python
    from litellm import completion
    import os

    # Example 1: Calling OpenAI's GPT-4o
    try:
        response_openai = completion(
            model="gpt-4o", 
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key benefit of a unified API?"}]
        )
        print("‚úÖ OpenAI Response:", response_openai.choices[0].message.content)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå OpenAI Error: {e}")

    # Example 2: Calling Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet with the exact same format
    try:
        response_anthropic = completion(
            model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key benefit of a unified API?"}]
        )
        print("‚úÖ Anthropic Response:", response_anthropic.choices[0].message.content)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Anthropic Error: {e}")

    # Example 3: Calling a local model via Ollama (e.g., Llama 3)
    # Ensure the Ollama server is running (`ollama serve`) and the model is pulled (`ollama pull llama3`).
    try:
        response_ollama = completion(
            model="ollama/llama3", 
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short story about a friendly robot."}],
            api_base="http://localhost:11434" # Specify the local server address
        )
        print("‚úÖ Ollama Response:", response_ollama.choices[0].message.content)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Ollama Error: {e}\nEnsure the Ollama server is running.")
    ```

### Advanced Features & Production Readiness
<details - open>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Configuring LiteLLM for Robust Production Environments</summary>

---

#### Configuration (`config.yaml`)
- **Purpose**: A central YAML file is the recommended way to manage all settings for the LiteLLM Proxy or SDK Router, separating configuration from code.
- **Key Sections**:
  - `model_list`: Define all available models, their provider-specific parameters (`litellm_params`), API keys (referenced from environment variables), and rate limits (`tpm`/`rpm`).
  - `litellm_settings`: Global settings like `fallbacks`, `alerting`, and verbosity (`set_verbose`).
  - `router_settings`: Configure routing strategies (e.g., `least-busy`) and caching for the `litellm.Router`.
- **Example `config.yaml`**:
  ```yaml
  model_list:
    - model_name: gpt-4-fallback-group # An alias for a group of models
      litellm_params:
        model: gpt-4o
        api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY
    - model_name: gpt-4-fallback-group # Same alias, making it part of the group
      litellm_params:
        model: claude-3-opus-20240229
        api_key: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

  litellm_settings:
    # If a call to "gpt-4-fallback-group" with the gpt-4o model fails,
    # LiteLLM will automatically retry with the claude-3-opus model.
    fallbacks:
      - gpt-4-fallback-group:
        - claude-3-opus-20240229

  router_settings:
    # Enable smart caching for all routes, storing results for 1 hour
    cache_responses: true
    cache_kwargs:
      type: redis # or "local"
      ttl: 3600
  ```
- **Using the Config with the Proxy**:
  ```bash
  litellm --config /path/to/your/config.yaml --port 8000
  ```

---

#### Observability & Callbacks
- **Purpose**: To gain deep insight into LLM usage, performance, and costs.
- **How it Works**: LiteLLM can send detailed logs of every call to specified platforms using callbacks.
- **Example (SDK)**:
  ```python
  import litellm
  import os

  # Set API keys for observability platforms
  os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "your-langfuse-pk"
  os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "your-langfuse-sk"
  os.environ["HELICONE_API_KEY"] = "your-helicone-key"

  # Enable callbacks for successful and failed calls
  litellm.success_callback = ["langfuse", "helicone"]
  litellm.failure_callback = ["langfuse", "helicone"]

  # Any `litellm.completion()` call will now be automatically logged.
  try:
      litellm.completion(
          model="gpt-4o-mini",
          messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Log this call!"}]
      )
      print("Call logged successfully to Langfuse and Helicone.")
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Call failed but was still logged. Error: {e}")
  ```

## LangGraph Deep Dive
---

### What is LangGraph?
<details - open>
<summary>üìú Core Concepts, Differentiators, and Architecture</summary>

---

- **Definition**:
  - LangGraph is a Python library, built on top of LangChain, for creating powerful, stateful, and multi-actor AI applications. It allows developers to define complex workflows as a **graph**.
  - It is specifically designed to handle **cycles**, which are essential for building sophisticated agents that can reason, reflect, and retry tasks.

- **Key Differentiator from LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**:
  - **LCEL**: Excellent for creating Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), where data flows in one direction (e.g., `prompt -> model -> output_parser`). It cannot handle loops.
  - **LangGraph**: Designed for cyclic graphs. This allows an agent to loop back to a previous step, for example, to re-evaluate its plan after a tool fails or to refine an answer based on new information.

#### LangGraph Core Concepts

- **State (`StateGraph`)**:
  - The central concept. It's a Python object (typically a `TypedDict` or Pydantic model) that acts as the "memory" of the agent.
  - The state is passed to every node, and each node can update the state. This ensures a consistent context throughout the workflow.

- **Nodes**:
  - The building blocks of the graph. Each node is a Python function or an LCEL runnable that performs a specific action.
  - Examples: a node to call an LLM for a plan, a node to execute a search tool, a node to format the final answer.

- **Edges**:
  - The connections that define the path through the graph.
  - **Standard Edges**: Unconditionally direct the flow from one node to the next.
  - **Conditional Edges**: The "decision-making" mechanism. A special function evaluates the current state and decides which node to go to next. This is how you create branches and loops.
  - **`START` and `END`**: Special entry and exit points for the graph.

- **Compiled Graph**:
  - Once the nodes and edges are defined, you `compile()` the graph into a runnable application object.

### Workflow Capabilities & Agent Patterns
<details - open>
<summary>üß© Building Advanced Agents and Workflows</summary>

---

- **Core Capabilities**:
  - **Self-Correction**: An agent can evaluate its own output, and if it's not satisfactory, loop back to an earlier step to try again with a different approach.
  - **Multi-step Reasoning**: Break down a complex problem into a series of smaller, manageable steps (nodes).
  - **Tool Use**: Seamlessly integrate tools (e.g., web search, database query, code execution) as nodes within the graph.
  - **Human-in-the-Loop**: Create explicit points in the workflow where the agent must pause and wait for human input or approval before continuing.
  - **Multi-Agent Systems**: Construct complex systems where multiple, specialized agents (each represented by its own graph) collaborate to solve a problem.

- **Common Agent Patterns**:
  - **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)**: A powerful pattern where the agent iterates through a `Thought -> Action -> Observation` loop. LangGraph's support for cycles makes implementing ReAct straightforward.
    - **ReAct Loop Visualization**:
      ```mermaid
      graph TD
        A[Start] --> B(üí° Agent: Generate Thought & Action);
        B --> C{Is Action a Tool?};
        C -- Yes --> D[üõ†Ô∏è Tool Node: Execute Action];
        D --> E[üëÄ Observation Node: Process Tool Output];
        E --> B;
        C -- No, Final Answer --> F[‚úÖ End: Respond to User];
      ```
  - **Plan-and-Execute**: The agent first creates a detailed, step-by-step plan (one node) and then iterates through executing each step of the plan (another set of nodes).

### Installation and Basic Usage
<details - open>
<summary>üõ†Ô∏è Installation and a Simple Chatbot Example</summary>

---

- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  pip install langgraph langchain langchain_openai
  ```

- **Basic Chatbot with State Example**:
  - This example demonstrates a simple graph with one node that updates a list of messages in the state.
  ```python
  from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
  from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
  from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
  from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage, HumanMessage
  from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
  import os

  # Ensure OpenAI API key is set
  # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-key"

  # 1. Define the state for our graph
  # `add_messages` is a special helper that appends new messages to the existing list.
  class ChatState(TypedDict):
      messages: Annotated[list[BaseMessage], add_messages]

  # 2. Define a node that calls an LLM
  def chatbot_node(state: ChatState):
      print("üí¨ Chatbot Node: Calling LLM...")
      # The state contains the message history. The node's job is to get the next response.
      llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini") # Could be any LangChain chat model
      response = llm.invoke(state["messages"])
      # The node returns a dictionary with the key to update in the state.
      # `add_messages` will handle appending this new AI message.
      return {"messages": [response]}

  # 3. Build the graph
  graph_builder = StateGraph(ChatState)

  # Add the node to the graph
  graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot_node)

  # Set the entry point and the end point
  graph_builder.set_entry_point("chatbot")
  graph_builder.add_edge("chatbot", END) # The graph finishes after the chatbot node runs once.

  # 4. Compile the graph into a runnable application
  app = graph_builder.compile()

  # 5. Invoke the app and see the state update
  try:
      # We can run the graph multiple times, and the state will be maintained if we pass it back in.
      initial_input = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hi! What is LangGraph?")]}
      final_state = app.invoke(initial_input)

      print("\n--- Final State ---")
      for message in final_state["messages"]:
          print(f"[{message.type.upper()}]: {message.content}")
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"‚ùå Error invoking graph: {e}")
  ```

## Comparative Analysis: LiteLLM vs. LangGraph
---

### High-Level Comparison Table
<details - open>
<summary>üìä Direct Feature and Purpose Comparison</summary>

---

- This table provides a side-by-side comparison to quickly understand the distinct roles of each tool.
  | Feature / Criterion | LiteLLM | LangGraph |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **Primary Purpose** | **Standardize LLM API Calls**: Manage access, cost, and reliability of communication with LLMs. | **Build Stateful AI Agents**: Orchestrate complex, multi-step workflows with logic and memory. |
  | **Core Abstraction** | **LLM Call**: A universal function (`completion`) to interact with any backend model. | **Graph**: A workflow of `Nodes` (actions) and `Edges` (logic) that operate on a shared `State`. |
  | **Scope of Use** | **Communication Layer**: Sits between your application and the LLM providers. | **Logic/Orchestration Layer**: Defines the "thinking process" of your AI application. |
  | **State Management** | **Stateless**: Manages individual API calls. It does not maintain application-level state. | **Stateful by Design**: The `StateGraph` is the core of the library, explicitly managing context. |
  | **Workflow/Cycles** | **No**: Does not manage workflows. It handles retries/fallbacks for a *single* call. | **Yes**: Natively supports cycles, loops, and conditional branching, which is its key strength. |
  | **Best For** | - Switching LLM backends<br>- Cost/performance optimization<br>- Centralized API gateway | - Complex, multi-step agents<br>- Self-correcting workflows<br>- Human-in-the-loop systems |
  | **Main Weakness** | Does not build agentic logic. | Does not manage the underlying LLM infrastructure (cost, fallbacks, etc.). |

### When to Use Which Tool? (Decision Framework)
<details - open>
<summary>üí° A Framework for Choosing the Right Tool</summary>

---

- **Choose `LiteLLM` when your primary need is related to the LLM *call* itself:**
  - "I need my application to work with both OpenAI and a local Ollama model without changing code."
  - "I need to track how much my staging environment is spending on LLM calls per day."
  - "I need to ensure my service doesn't go down if Anthropic's API has a temporary outage."
  - "I want to A/B test `gpt-4o-mini` vs. `claude-3-haiku` for a summarization task to see which is cheaper and faster."

- **Choose `LangGraph` when your primary need is related to the *workflow* or *logic* of your AI:**
  - "I need to build an agent that first searches the web, then reads the results, then writes a summary."
  - "If my agent's code execution tool fails, I want it to try a different approach."
  - "I need to build a chatbot that can ask clarifying questions if the user's request is ambiguous."
  - "I need a process where an AI generates a report, but it must be approved by a human before being sent."

- **The Production Standard: Use `LiteLLM` + `LangGraph` Together**
  - This is the most powerful and common pattern for building robust GenAI applications.
  - **LangGraph** defines the complex, stateful workflow of the agent.
  - **LiteLLM** is used *inside* the LangGraph nodes to handle all communication with LLMs, providing reliability, cost control, and flexibility.

## Integration Strategy & Architecture
---

### The "Why": Synergistic Benefits
<details - open>
<summary>üåü Why Combining LiteLLM and LangGraph is the Best of Both Worlds</summary>

---

- **Decoupling Logic from Infrastructure**:
  - LangGraph focuses on what it does best: orchestrating the agent's logical flow.
  - LiteLLM focuses on what it does best: managing the messy reality of dealing with multiple LLM APIs.
  - This separation of concerns makes the application cleaner, easier to maintain, and more scalable.

- **Enhanced Production-Readiness**:
  - **Reliability**: A LangGraph agent becomes more robust because its LLM calls (managed by LiteLLM) can automatically fall back to other models.
  - **Cost Control**: You can centrally track and budget the cost of all LLM calls made by your complex LangGraph agent.
  - **Flexibility**: You can change the underlying LLM used by a LangGraph node by simply updating the LiteLLM config file, with zero changes to the agent's code.
  - **Simplified Node Code**: The code inside each LangGraph node that needs an LLM becomes a simple, consistent `litellm.completion()` call, regardless of the model being used.

#### Implementation Example: LangGraph Node using LiteLLM
- This node decides which LLM to use based on the task, then calls it via `litellm.completion`. This logic could also be offloaded entirely to a LiteLLM Proxy config.
  ```python
  from litellm import completion as litellm_completion
  from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
  from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
  from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage
  import os

  # LiteLLM will pick up keys from the environment
  # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-key"
  # os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your-anthropic-key"

  class AgentState(TypedDict):
      task: str
      input_text: str
      messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], lambda x, y: x + y]
      result: str

  # This LangGraph node uses LiteLLM to perform a task
  def litellm_powered_node(state: AgentState):
      task = state["task"]
      input_text = state["input_text"]
      print(f"ü§ñ Node executing task: '{task}'")

      # Logic to select the best model for the task
      if task == "summary":
          model = "gpt-4o-mini" # Cost-effective for summarization
          prompt = f"Please provide a concise summary of the following text: {input_text}"
      elif task == "translate_to_french":
          model = "claude-3-haiku-20240307" # Good at multilingual tasks
          prompt = f"Translate the following text to French: {input_text}"
      else:
          model = "gpt-4o" # Default powerful model for general tasks
          prompt = input_text

      print(f"üìû Calling LiteLLM with model: '{model}'")
      try:
          # Unified call using LiteLLM, abstracting away the provider
          response = litellm_completion(
              model=model, 
              messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
          )
          llm_result = response.choices[0].message.content
          print(f"‚úÖ LiteLLM Response received.")
          
          # Update the state with the result and the AI's response message
          return {"result": llm_result, "messages": [AIMessage(content=llm_result)]}

### Deployment & Operational Considerations
<details - open>
<summary>üöÄ Real-world Implementation and Maintenance Strategy</summary>

---

#### Configuration Management
- **Single Source of Truth**: Use a `config.yaml` file for the LiteLLM Proxy to manage all model definitions, API keys, fallbacks, and routing rules.
- **Environment Separation**: Maintain separate `config.yaml` files for development, staging, and production environments.
- **Version Control**: Store your `config.yaml` in Git to track changes to your LLM infrastructure over time.

---

#### Observability Stack
- **Trace Agent Logic**: Use **LangSmith** or **Langfuse** to trace the execution of your LangGraph agents. This provides a visual representation of the graph's flow, making it easy to debug complex logic.
- **Monitor LLM Calls**: Configure LiteLLM callbacks to send detailed call logs (including cost, latency, and tokens) to your chosen observability platform (e.g., Langfuse, Helicone, Datadog, Prometheus).
- **Combined View**: By using both, you get a complete picture: LangSmith shows *why* an LLM was called (the agent's logic), while LiteLLM's logs show *how* the call was executed (which model, latency, cost, any fallbacks).

---

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **LangGraph Layer**: Handle *logical* errors. Use conditional edges to route the agent to a "correction" or "error handling" node if a tool fails or the LLM output is invalid.
- **LiteLLM Layer**: Handle *communication* errors. Configure automatic retries for transient network issues and fallbacks for API outages or rate limit errors. This makes the agent more resilient without cluttering its core logic with infrastructure concerns.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

### Final Recommendations for Development Teams
<details - open>
<summary>üí° Actionable Advice for Implementing GenAI Solutions</summary>

---

- **1. Start with LiteLLM for All LLM Access**:
  - For any new project, integrate LiteLLM (SDK for small projects, Proxy for larger ones) from day one. This immediately provides flexibility, cost control, and resilience, preventing future refactoring pain.

- **2. Adopt LangGraph for Complex Logic, Not Simple Calls**:
  - If your application is a simple `input -> LLM -> output` chain, LangGraph is overkill. Use a simple LiteLLM call.
  - As soon as your application requires multiple steps, tool use, self-correction, or state management, introduce LangGraph to structure that logic cleanly.

- **3. Prioritize the Integrated Architecture**:
  - The most robust, scalable, and maintainable production architecture combines both tools.
  - **LangGraph** orchestrates the high-level agent workflow.
  - **LiteLLM** (preferably the Proxy) serves as the underlying "LLM-as-a-service" layer for the entire organization.

- **4. Embrace a Config-Driven Approach**:
  - Keep your agent's code focused on logic. Move all infrastructure details‚Äîmodel names, API keys, fallbacks, caching rules‚Äîinto a LiteLLM `config.yaml` file. This allows operations teams to tune performance and manage costs without requiring code changes.

- **5. Invest in Observability Early**:
  - Set up LangSmith/Langfuse for agent tracing and LiteLLM callbacks for call logging from the beginning. Debugging complex AI systems without proper observability is incredibly difficult and time-consuming.
